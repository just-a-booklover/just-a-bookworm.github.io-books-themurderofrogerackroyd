 <p><strong>Plot: </strong>Roger Ackroyd knew too much. He knew that the woman he loved had poisoned her brutal first husband. He suspected also that someone had been blackmailing her. Now, tragically, came the news that she had taken her own life with a drug overdose.<br>
But the evening post brought Roger one last fatal scrap of information. Unfortunately, before he could finish the letter, he was stabbed to deathâ€¦
</p>	 	

 <p><strong>My opinion: </strong>what a pity I knew who the murderer was from the beginning.<br>
I didn't mean to find it out, but I was reading something about Agatha Christie and about "The murder of Roger Ackroyd" and... it was written the murderer. When I realized what I read I stopped and tried to forget it, but nothing. And, when I started the book I was sure I misunderstood everything: the culprit <em>couldn't</em> be the one I read. I felt good and enjoyed the mystery trying to guess the ending. Well, I hadn't misunderstood. The sad part is that I didn't completely like the book because of the huge spoiler. I would have absolutely loved it, and instead all I could think of was something along the lines of "Meh, how do they say it's the best book by Agatha Christie?". I feel sad.<br>
The thing I liked of the book is that everyone could be the murderer: Hercule Poirot always discovers new clues and new secrets against everyone (except for the real murderer, of course, but at the end everything points against him/her). Moreover, all those clues make the mystery more tangled, more difficult and when you think you have an idea of how the things went... new secrets are discovered!<br>
Because you can try to guess or recreate the events of the evening when Ackroyd was killed (as the main character does), but you would never include all the clues. They point in every direction, they seem to not make sense, and what Poirot judges important is just a detail.<br>
Even if I don't completely like the book I can say it's really a masterpiece among the crime books, the mystery is so odd and complicated, with so many details... I enjoyed it very much until the end. And also then I was frozen while reading the explanation from Hercule Poirot. Because I knew who the murderer was, but not how he could have killed Ackroyd. There was nearly nothing against him/her and I'm still impressed by Poirot's skills (and Christie's of course). It's so original, but when everything was explained I wasn't shocked, just bored, I guess. <br>
I feel bad, because it's a masterpiece (I know I already said it, but it really is) and I can't appreciate it.

<p><strong>Quotes: </strong><br>
Everyone had a hand in the elucidation of the mystery. It was rather like a jigsaw puzzle to which everyone contributed their own little piece of knowledge or discovery. But their task ended there. To Poirot alone belongs the renown of fitting those pieces into their correct place.<br>
Fortunately words, ingeniously used, will serve to mask the ugliness of naked facts.<br>
But I wish Hercule Poirot had never retired from work and come here to grow vegetable marrows. / the excipit is just perfect
